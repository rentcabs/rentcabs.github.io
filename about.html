      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <hr><br>
      <p>There might be lakhs of cab companies which offer the same packages we do. We do not claim that we are extra special and extra awesome.</p>
      <p>But what we claim and also guarantee is that we are a bunch of hard working people, trying our best to provide the absolute best service we can. </p>
      <p>We employ earnest drivers and employees whose sole ambition is to provide the customer with an extraordinarily good service. That, is our business model.</p>
      <p>We are a company based in Bangalore. We are the subsidary of another excellent cab company, S.B Car Rentals. We provide cabs which are the best vehicles with exceedingly good comfort and provide the best possible level of enjoyability you could possibly get from travelling in a car or bus.</p>
      <p>We also cater to the needs of corporate employee transport, wedding requests (not staff,vehicles only), airport car rentals, city to city transports, honeymoon trips, vacations and tours, sightseeing trips, pilgrimage trips and pretty much everything else, really.</p>
      <p>If you have read this far and are interested, give us a call (or at least a missed call, you cheapskate) and we will get back to you as soon as we can.</p>
